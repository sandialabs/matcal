Introduction Examples
*********************
After a brief introduction to Python 
and object oriented programming,
this set of examples covers basic calibrations 
using either PythonModels (see :class:`~matcal.core.models.PythonModel`) or SIERRA models.
The first set focus on Python models where calibrations are performed 
to data sets with known solutions. These are intended to 
show MatCal's basic input file structure and usage. A few also touch on 
calibration issues to be weary of for calibrations with 
analytical objectives that can easily be visualized for 
demonstration purposes.

These are then followed with more applied examples 
with similar goals using a MatCal 
generated SIERRA model for a uniaxially loaded 
material point (:ref:`Uniaxial Loading Material Point Model`). 
First a successful calibration is shown with justifications for 
decisions made and tools used for that calibration. Next, 
common issues that may be encountered in applied problems are 
explored using the same data set from the successful calibration.
