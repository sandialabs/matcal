In this gallery of examples, we show how to use MatCal
to perform calibration with real experimental data. MatCal 
has several calibration, uncertainty quantification and
sensitivity study tools to use, and these examples demonstrate
how to use them when applied to data from different materials. As the features are 
developed and documented more feature examples will be added
here to highlight their use.
