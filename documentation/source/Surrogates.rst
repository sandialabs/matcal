Surrogates
**********
For complex physics or characterization tests, 
the computational cost of models used for calibration can 
make the use of some calibration methods impractical. 
The ability to use surrogates that accurately 
reproduce model results can facilitate more rigorous 
calibrations. This section covers the surrogate 
generation tools available within MatCal and 
how to incorporate them in the calibration process.

Gaussian Process Surrogates Theory 
=================================
These surrogates are based on those developed in :cite:`pca_gp_surrogates`.
