        "\n# Basic Python Overview\n\nThis chapter serves as a basic primer into using Python and working with object-oriented code. If you are familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip this chapter. \n\n## Python Introduction  \n\nPython is a very flexible coding language that has been around since the early 1990's. Python has a wealth of pre-written code that makes it very easy to \nget up and running quicky with almost any coding project. MatCal is one of these libraries of pre-written code. Using MatCal does not require any \nadvanced knowledge of Python but understanding some of Python's fundamental operations is critical for using MatCal. \n\nThis primer covers the topics that are relevant for using MatCal. The selected topics are by no means an exhaustive list of the topics in Python\nbut should serve as a decent starting place for working with MatCal. \n\n## How to Run Python\n\nTo run Python code, your computer needs a Python interpreter. Because Python is so widely used, most computers comes with a pre-existing Python interpreter. \nUsing a terminal, you can run a Python file by executing the following.::\n\n  python my_python_file.py\n\nThis will call up the Python interpreter and run the commands written in the file 'my_python_file.py'. Another way of executing Python code it to use the Python \ninterpreter interactively. To do this simply execute the Python command without any filenames.:: \n\n  python\n\nThis will cause the terminal to become an interactive Python session. Now any thing you type will be interpreted as a Python command, and typing ``exit()``, will leave\nthe interactive session. An interactive session is useful for doing simple calculations, and confirming syntax. However, recording commands in a \nPython file and executing Python on the file is the generally the best way to work on larger tasks with Python. \n\nA Python file is simply a plain text file that has Python commands written in it. To create a new Python file, open a text editor, like \"gedit\", and write a few \nPython commands and save it. The file can now be run by a Python interpreter. By convention, Python files are saved with a \".py\" extension, however this is not necessary. \n\nMatCal is written in Python3, and any interpreter used needs to be running a Python version 3 or newer. If MatCal is run on an older Python version, then \nit will not work, and it will report errors about valid sections of code.\n\n## Variables in Python\n\nIn Python variables are declared using ``=``, as the assignment operator, where the variable on the left is assigned the value of whatever is on the right. \n"

The data the object stores are the entries of the list,\nand one of the actions we can tell the list to do is to add more items to it. This is done using the ``append`` method. Methods are functions that cause the object to do something.\nThese methods act on the object they are called and can use input from users through the form of arguments as would any function. \nLists have other methods as well such as ``pop``, which allows you to remove items from a list.

Which then allowed us to systematically total up the values in the dictionary. \nIn this example there are a few important things to notice. The first is how we defined what we are looping over. A common Python loop format is ``for X in Y``. Where X will \niterate over all entries defined by Y. In our case ``fruit_index`` will loop through 0, 1, and 2. We get these numbers using the built-in Python functions ``range`` (which defines an \nappropriate index list based on the total number of entries in an object with length) and ``len`` (which returns the length of an object). \n\nThe second thing to notice is how we defined the start and end of the code to be executed in our loop. In the loop declaration it ends with a ``:``. Colons in Python\ndefine what is known as a context block. A context block represents a subset of code that another line (or lines) of code manages. All code inside a context block \nmust be indented, this creates a nice readable demarcation of where context blocks are. The indentations in a given block must be the same number of spaces. \n\n"
