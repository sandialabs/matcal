        "\n# Exploring Different Model Forms: For Better and Worse...\n\nThis last section will explore calibrating different model forms to the Ductile Failure \n6061-T6 aluminum compression data. We will show how the final objective function values \nfor a set of calibrated models can be used to help decide which is the best model form \nfor the data. However, we will also show how overfitting a model could provide a better \nobjective value over another model form but be a poor model for the material. We do this \nwith three additional calibrations for the following three model forms:\n\n#. Double Voce hardening \n#. Power law hardening without Luders strain \n#. Power law hardening with Luders strain.\n\nThe flow rule for Double Voce hardening is defined by:\n\n\\begin{align}\\sigma_f = Y + A_1\\left[1-\\exp\\left(-b_1\\varepsilon_p\\right)\\right] + A_2\\left[1-\\exp\\left(-b_2\\varepsilon\\right)\\right]\\end{align}\n\nwhere $Y$ is the yield, $\\varepsilon_p$ is the material equivalent plastic strain\nand $A_1$, $b_1$, $A_2$, $b_2$ are the parameters for the two Voce hardening model components that \nwe are using for this calibration. \nThis hardening model allows for a little more flexibility when fitting material data. Generally, it results in a lower yield stress\nand one of the Voce components is used to model the low strain portion of the curve just before yield while the other Voce component \nis used to model the high strain portion of the curve. \n\nThe flow rule for \npower law hardening is \n\n\\begin{align}\\sigma_f = Y + A\\left<\\varepsilon_p-\\varepsilon_L\\right>^n\\end{align}\n\nwhere $Y$ is once again the material yield, $A$ is the hardening modulus,  \n$n$ is the hardening exponent and $\\varepsilon_L$ is the Luders strain.\nPower law hardening is a commonly used engineering material model\nthat cannot simulate materials with a clear saturation stress such as the aluminum being studied\nhere. We will look at two forms of this model, one where the Luders strain is set to zero and \nanother where we allow it to calibrate the Luders strain to the data even though Luders strain \nis clearly not present in this material data set.\n\nWe begin this example as we have the others by first importing the calibration tools and the data \nbefore setting up the models.\n"
