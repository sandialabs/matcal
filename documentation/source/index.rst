MatCal Users Guide
******************

Welcome to the MatCal Users' Guide. If this is your
first time using MatCal, start at :ref:`Introduction` to learn 
what MatCal is and what it can do for material model calibrations. 
The remaining chapters provide details on the tools 
available within MatCal including general overviews on what they can be used for, 
some light background on theory and implementation details. Many 
of these chapters also include verification and user examples.
The final chapter is the User API Documentation that gives standard API 
documentation for user facing tools.

To run MatCal at Sandia see :ref:`Running MatCal at Sandia`.
We also allow you to import MatFit. See :ref:`Running MatFit`.

If you have any problems or feedback, feel free to reach out to the MatCal developers 
by email. Also, email us to be added to the matcal-users-group metagroup for 
emails about updates and new releases.
