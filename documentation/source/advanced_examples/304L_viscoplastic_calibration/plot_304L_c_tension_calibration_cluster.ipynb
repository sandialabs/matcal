The rate dependence parameters $Y_0$ and $C$ can be calibrated using \n   a :class:`~matcal.core.models.PythonModel` \n   and the 0.2\\% offset yield stress values\n   extracted from the nonstandard tension data taken at several rates. Note that since the \n   0.2\\% offset yield measured in the experiments does \n   not necessarily correspond to the material model $Y_0$,\n   the python model will have an additional parameter, \n   $X$, to compensate for this difference. \n#.

In this case, each evaluation \nset has a single objective, model and data/data_collection. \nAs a result, MatCal will track two objectives for this problem.\n\n.. note ::\n  MatCal can also accept multiple objectives passed to a single evaluation set in the form of an\n  :class:`~matcal.core.objective.ObjectiveCollection`. \n  You can also add evaluation sets for a given \n  model multiple times. This is useful when you have different types \n  of data from the experiments and \n  must use different objectives on these data sets. \n  An example would be calibrating to both stress-strain and temperature-time data.\n  Sometimes the experimental data is not collocated in time and supplied in different files.\n  In such a case, you could calibrate\n  to both by adding two evaluation sets for the model, \n  one for stress-strain and another for temperature-time.\n\nAfter adding the evaluation sets, we need to set the study core limit. \nMatCal takes advantage of \nmultiple cores in two layers. Most models can be run on several cores, all studies can run \nevaluation sets in parallel (all models for a combined objective \nevaluation can be run concurrently), and most \nstudies can run several combined objective evaluations concurrently. \nFor this case, we need 1 core for the python model and \n36 cores for the tension model in each combined objective evaluation. \nThe study itself supports objective evaluation \nconcurrently up to $n+1$ where $n$ is the number of parameters. \nSee the \nstudy specific documentation for the objective evaluation concurrency for other methods.\nFor this case, the study will perform six (five parameters + 1) concurrent combined\nobjective evaluations, so this study can use at most 37*6 cores. \nSince this is a relatively large number of cores, we set the core limit to 112.\nThis limit is total number of cores we can use on the computational resources we plan \nto run this on. \nIf you have fewer cores, \nset the limit to what is available and MatCal will not use \nmore than what is specified. If no core limit is set,\nMatCal will default to 1. For parallel jobs, you must specify the limit\nor MatCal will error out. These specifications are for running jobs on a local machine.\n\n"

This is likely the primary cause for its higher\nobjective value. This demonstrates why it is typically a good practice to weight objectives or residuals by the inverse of the\nvariance or noise of the data.

The same can be accomplished by the \nuser by using the :class:`~matcal.core.residuals.ConstantFactorWeighting` with the appropriate scale factor.\nFor this problem, the calibration \nis acceptable without it and it is not necessarily needed because objectives \nare fairly decoupled.
