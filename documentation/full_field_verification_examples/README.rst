Full-field Methods Verification
===============================
In this set of examples, we perform 
verification exercises for MatCal's 
full-field data methods. These examples
provide verification of some of the 
tools that contribute to full-field
data calibration. These verification 
examples are extensions to some of the 
tests that are required to pass 
for each MatCal update.
